# Pattern Programs in Java
Pattern Programs in Java is a collection of console-based Java applications that showcase various numeric and character printing patterns. These programs are designed for beginners to practice fundamental concepts like nested loops, conditional statements, and array manipulations, generating shapes such as triangles, pyramids, diamonds, and more using asterisks (*) or numbers.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔢 **Numeric Patterns**: Programs to print patterns using numbers (e.g., ascending/descending triangles, Fibonacci series in grids).
- ⭐ **Character Patterns**: Designs with symbols like asterisks for visual shapes (e.g., right-angled triangles, hollow squares).
- 📐 **Geometric Shapes**: Includes pyramids, diamonds, and rhombus patterns with customizable sizes.
- 🔄 **Loop Mastery**: Demonstrates for, while, and do-while loops for row/column iterations.
- 📊 **Scalable Outputs**: Easy to modify row counts for different pattern sizes, with clear console rendering.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Java** – Core programming language for logic and output handling
- **Standard Libraries** – Utilizes basic I/O and control flow from JDK

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Each program is a standalone `.java` file in the `src` directory (e.g., `Pattern1.java` for a basic star triangle).
2. The main method in each file contains nested loops to calculate and print rows/columns of the pattern.
3. Customize the pattern size by editing the loop limits (e.g., `for(int i=1; i<=n; i++)` where `n` is the number of rows).
4. Run a specific program to see the pattern output in the console—no GUI or external inputs required.
5. All programs focus on dry runs for logic verification before execution.

## 🧪 Setup & Installation
### 📋 Prerequisites
- JDK 8 or higher installed
- A Java IDE like VS Code with Java Extension Pack, or command-line tools

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preveen369/Pattern_Programs_in_Java.git
cd Pattern_Programs_in_Java
```

### 🧑‍💻 Steps to run
1. **Using Command Line**
   ```bash
   # Compile a specific program (e.g., Pattern1.java)
   javac src/Pattern1.java
   # Run it
   java -cp src Pattern1
   ```
2. **Using VS Code**
   - Open the project folder in VS Code.
   - Use the Java extension to build and run any `.java` file directly (right-click > Run Java).
   
Explore different patterns by compiling and running each file individually! No additional dependencies needed.
